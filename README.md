Project Overview:

The project will utilize a dataset containing historical temperature change information. The primary objectives include:

Initial visualization and exploration of temperature change trends over time.
Applying various supervised learning models, such as Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Ridge Regression, to predict temperature changes.
Comparing the predictive performance of these models using cross-validation techniques.
Understanding predictor contributions through regression coefficients and feature importance analysis.
Evaluating estimation stability via bootstrap resampling, providing insights into the robustness of the models.
